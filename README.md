# codeonpaper
    This platform helps you to prepare for personal interviews where your are expected to write code on paper.

# Common issues : 
      •	Prepared everything, still feels incomplete.
      •	Done enough online coding but not confident enough to write code on paper.
      •	In Personal Interviews: Interviewer asked question…
              	Scenario 1: I know the solution, not able to recall. Should I think from scratch?
              	Scenario 2: I don’t know the solution, but took a lot of time to come up with any good solution. 
# Reason for above issues:
Started one topic say.. Link list. Prepared 30 questions in one go, moved to trees , Link list gets overridden. Again start Link            list… move to arrays , link list is gone again….. frustration…can’t handle ….too many questions!! Bla.. blaa..
# Key to conquer PIs:
Your brain should be active at that particular time of span. Having said that, I mean your brain should be ready for random questions.
CodeOnpaper is an outcome of my personal experience. It will help you to train your brain for totally randomness of the personal    interviews.
